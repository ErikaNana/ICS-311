###Project 2: Graph ADT and Algorithms
####Storing data<br>
* <b>Adjacency Matrix:  </b>Only when add/remove edges and check for their existence
* <b>Adjacency List:  </b>Only adding edges or enumerating the neighbors of vertices
* <b>Adjacency Tree:  </b>Need to find/delete edges as well as create them
* <b>Adjacency List/Tree:  </b>Only need to enumerate edges and not find/add/delete (but in practice list is better)
